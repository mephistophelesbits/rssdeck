## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Ollama (for local AI features)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mephistophelesbits/rssdeck.git
cd rssdeck

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (often runs on port 3000 or 3001)
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:3001 if 3000 is taken)
```

### Docker Deployment (Pre-built Image)

> [!NOTE]
> The pre-built image is optimized for `amd64`. If you are on a **Mac with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)**, we recommend [building locally](#docker-deployment-build-locally) for better performance.

```bash
# One-line deploy (Mac users may need --platform linux/amd64)
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v rss-data:/app/data --name rssdeck --platform linux/amd64 kianfong/rssdeck:latest

# Or with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Docker Deployment (Build Locally)

This is the **recommended method for Mac Apple Silicon** users to ensure native performance.

```bash
# Clone and build locally
git clone https://github.com/mephistophelesbits/rssdeck.git
cd rssdeck
docker-compose up -d --build

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

#### 🛡️ Troubleshooting Mac Docker Errors

If you see `no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8 in the manifest list entries`, it means you're trying to pull an `amd64` image on an `arm64` Mac. 

**Solution:** Use the **Build Locally** method above, or add `--platform linux/amd64` to your `docker run` command.

### Ollama Setup

```bash
# Install Ollama
# Download from https://ollama.ai

# Pull a model (recommended: llama3.2 or mistral)
ollama pull llama3.2

# RSS Deck will automatically connect to Ollama at http://localhost:11434
```

## 📝 The Story Behind RSS Deck

I built RSS Deck because I missed the command-center feeling of TweetDeck, but wanted modern features:
- Full article content (not just snippets)
- Local AI for summarization and chat
- Beautiful, distraction-free reading

As someone who "can't code," I built this entirely through "vibe coding" with AI tools. If I can build this, imagine what you could create too.
