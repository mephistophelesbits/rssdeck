> **RSS Deck has been renamed to IntelliDeck.**
>
> Same project, new identity. The name better reflects what this tool has grown into — not just a feed reader, but an active news intelligence layer that reads, analyzes, and briefs you. All existing data is forward-compatible. Just pull the new image or update your clone.

Remember TweetDeck? That feeling of having everything in view — your feeds laid out in columns, nothing hidden, nothing buried? IntelliDeck brings that back. Except now there's an AI sitting alongside you, reading with you, summarizing for you, and alerting you to exactly what matters.

This is not a reader with AI bolted on. **The AI is the point.**

## What's New in v3.0

### New name. New logo. Native desktop app.

- **Renamed** from RSS Deck → **IntelliDeck** — a name that matches what the product actually does
- **New origami north star logo** — a 4-pointed compass star built from 12 shaded facets, representing precision, direction, and intelligent synthesis
- **macOS native app** — download the `.dmg` and run IntelliDeck as a first-class Mac app. No browser tab, no Docker required. Standalone bundled server, native window chrome, dock integration, system tray, and menu bar

## Core Features

### 🤖 Local AI — Zero Cloud
Powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.ai). Your AI runs entirely on your own machine. No data leaves your network, no subscriptions, no API quotas.

### ☀️ Morning Briefing
Your AI acts as a News Intelligence Officer — reading across all feeds, selecting strategic headlines, and writing a concise brief. Delivered to Telegram if you want it there.

### 🔔 Keyword Alerts
Define topics that matter — company names, people, technologies. IntelliDeck highlights matching articles across all feeds in real time.

### 📖 Inline Full-Content Reading
Click an article and it opens as a dedicated column beside the feed — full text via Mozilla Readability, no paywalls, no ad pages, no tab switching.

### 🗂 Feed Lists
Organize feeds into named lists. Switch between topic-specific views without rebuilding your layout.

### 🌍 Intelligence Map
Geo-tagged article extraction builds a live world map of where your news is coming from.

## The Story

I built this because I missed TweetDeck and wanted something modern — full article content, local AI, beautiful themes. The twist: I can't code. The entire thing was built through vibe coding with AI tools.

IntelliDeck is a project built with AI, powered by AI, for people who want to read with AI. That's not a coincidence.
