# Andrej Karpathy's "Claws" - AI Agents Get a Name

Andrej Karpathy (the AI researcher who coined "vibe coding") is now talking about "Claws" — AI agents that run on personal hardware, communicate via messaging protocols, and can schedule tasks.

> "I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level."

## Key Points

- **Hardware:** He bought a Mac Mini specifically to tinker with Claws
- **NanoClaw mentioned:** ~4000 lines of code, runs in containers, "fits in both my head and that of AI agents"
- **Emoji:** 🦞 (lobster)
- **Skepticism:** He's "a bit sus'd" about OpenClaw specifically but loves the concept

## The Landscape

Other emerging "Claws":
- NanoClaw
- Nanobot
- ZeroClaw
- IronClaw
- PicoClaw

## What This Means

"Claw" is becoming the term of art for personal AI assistants that:
1. Run on your machine
2. Communicate via messaging (Telegram, Slack, etc.)
3. Can act on instructions AND schedule tasks
4. Have persistence and context

This is exactly what OpenClaw builds. The terminology is legitimizing.
