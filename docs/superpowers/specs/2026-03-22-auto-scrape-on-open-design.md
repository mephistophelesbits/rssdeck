# Auto-Scrape on Article Open — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-03-22
**Status:** Approved
**Scope:** Automatically fetch full article content after the reading panel has been open for 4 seconds, when the feed didn't already provide full content.

---

## Overview

When a user clicks an article and leaves the reading panel open for 4 seconds, automatically call the existing scrape logic (`handleFetchFullArticle`) to pull the full article body via Mozilla Readability. This eliminates the need to manually click "Fetch Full Article" for most articles.

---

## Behaviour

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Article already has scraped content cached (`scrapedContent !== null`) | Do nothing — already have full content |
| Article's RSS feed content is ≥ 500 characters (`article.content?.length >= 500`) | Do nothing — feed provided full content |
| Otherwise | Start 4-second timer; on expiry call `handleFetchFullArticle()` |
| User switches to a different article before 4s | Cancel timer (no fetch) |
| Component unmounts before 4s | Cancel timer (no fetch) |

**500-character threshold:** RSS snippets are typically 100–200 chars. A genuine full-body article in the feed is almost always 500+ chars. This avoids redundant scraping when the feed already provides full text.

**No new UI:** The 4-second wait is silent. Once scraping starts, the existing `isScraping` spinner (already rendered in `ArticlePreviewPanel`) covers the loading state. No countdown indicator is needed.

## Implementation

### File changed

`components/ui/ArticlePreviewPanel.tsx` — add one `useEffect` after the existing article-change effect (~line 181).

### New effect

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  if (!article) return;
  if (scrapedContent) return;
  if ((article.content?.length ?? 0) >= 500) return;

  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    void handleFetchFullArticle();
  }, 4000);

  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [article?.id, scrapedContent]);
```

### Key decisions

- **`useRef` not needed** — the timer ID is captured by the closure in the cleanup function, so no ref is required.
- **`handleFetchFullArticle` already has all guards** — `if (!article || isScraping || scrapedContent) return;` prevents double-fetching even if the effect fires unexpectedly.
- **`article?.id` as dependency** — resets the timer whenever the user opens a different article.
- **`scrapedContent` as dependency** — cancels the timer if scraping was triggered manually before 4s elapsed.
- **`handleFetchFullArticle` intentionally omitted from deps** — it is a stable function defined in the same component render scope; including it would cause the effect to re-run unnecessarily. This follows the existing pattern in the file.

## Out of Scope

- No settings toggle to enable/disable auto-scrape.
- No visual countdown during the 4-second wait.
- No changes to the scrape API, cache logic, or any other component.
