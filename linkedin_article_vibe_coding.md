# LinkedIn Article: The Future of Work is "Vibe Coding"

## 🚀 The Future of Work Isn't Learning to Code — It's Learning to Collaborate with AI

---

I just shipped my first software product.

Let me repeat that: **I shipped a real product.** A full-stack Next.js application with Docker deployment, local AI integration, multi-column UI, and custom article scraping.

And I still can't write a single line of code. Not one line.

---

## The Old Way vs. The New Way

**The Old Way:**
- 2 years of coding bootcamp
- Master React, TypeScript, Node.js
- Learn Docker, deployment pipelines
- Debug for hours in terminal

**The New Way:**
- Know what you want to build
- Collaborate with AI (Claude, Antigravity, etc.)
- Review, iterate, ship

Same outcome. Completely different journey.

## What I Built: RSS Deck

📰 A multi-column RSS reader with:
- Full-article scraping (no more frustrating snippets)
- Local AI summarization (Ollama, no cloud APIs)
- Sentiment analysis dots (🟢 positive, 🔴 negative)
- "Chat with article" feature for deep dives
- Beautiful themes (Cyberpunk, Sepia, Dark, Light)

## The Real Skill: Clear Thinking

Here's what I learned: **The bottleneck isn't syntax knowledge. It's clarity of vision.**

When I told AI "I want TweetDeck for RSS feeds, but with full articles and AI summaries," it understood. It built.

When I said "Make it feel like a command center, but cozy," it understood. It built.

The back-and-forth wasn't about fixing syntax errors. It was about:
1. Describing what I wanted
2. AI proposing solutions
3. Me refining the vision
4. Repeat

**This is collaboration, not code generation.**

## What This Means for the Future

### For Non-Technical People

If you've ever thought "I have great ideas but I'm not technical," this era is different.

AI has democratized building. You don't need to learn syntax. You need:
- ✅ Clear thinking about what you want
- ✅ Ability to review and give feedback
- ✅ Persistence through iteration

That's it.

### For Technical People

Your value is shifting from "writing code" to "architecting solutions" and "guiding AI."

The people who thrive will be those who can:
- Break down complex problems
- Communicate clearly with AI
- Review outputs critically
- Assemble systems from AI-generated components

## My Practical Tips for "Vibe Coders"

1. **Start with the vibe, not the code**
   - Describe the user experience first
   - Let AI figure out the implementation

2. **Use the right tools**
   - Claude, ChatGPT, Antigravity
   - Each has different strengths

3. **Review like a product manager, not a compiler**
   - "Does this feel right?"
   - "Is this what I imagined?"
   - Not "Is this syntax correct?"

4. **Embrace iteration**
   - First version won't be perfect
   - Each round gets closer

5. **Document your vision**
   - Write down what you want before starting
   - Helps you communicate with AI

## The Bigger Picture

I'm a 20-year marketing veteran. I built agencies, led campaigns, won awards. I thought "building" was for other people.

Until now.

**The era of the "vibe coder" is here.** It's not about learning to code. It's about learning to collaborate with AI to build what you imagine.

And honestly? It's f*cking fun.

## What I'm Doing Next

I'm actively exploring my next chapter — whether in a senior marketing/leadership role where I can bring this AI-native mindset, or in building something new.

If you're:
- 🚀 Building something with AI
- 🏢 Looking for someone who understands both business AND can ship products
- 💡 Curious about "vibe coding"

Let's talk.
