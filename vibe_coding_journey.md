# From "No-Code" to "AI-Code": Building my Dream RSS Deck

## Introduction
I don’t know how to code. Or at least, I didn’t think I did. For years, I’ve been a "user" of software, often wishing I could tweak a button here or add a feature there. Today, I’m looking at a fully functional, high-performance RSS reader that I built—not by writing lines of syntax, but by "vibe coding."

My latest creation, **RSS Deck**, is more than just a project; it feels like a professional-grade software product. Here is how I took a feeling and turned it into the best news dashboard I've ever used.

## The Spark: A Love for TweetDeck
The journey started with a specific nostalgia. I’ve always loved the horizontal, column-based layout of TweetDeck. There’s something powerful about seeing multiple information streams side-by-side, moving at your own pace. I wanted that same "command center" feeling for the web articles and blogs I follow every day.

## Solving the "Snippet" Problem
One of the biggest frustrations with traditional RSS readers is that they only give you a tiny snippet of the article, forcing you to click away to a messy, ad-filled website to read the rest. 

I decided my app had to be different. I incorporated a custom **Article Scraper**. Now, when I click an article in my deck, the app automatically reaches out, pulls the full text, and cleans it up using Mozilla’s Readability engine. It’s like having a "Reader Mode" for every single site on the internet, built right into my dashboard.

## Bringing in the Brain: Local AI with Ollama
The "achievement" that feels most futuristic to me is the AI integration. I didn't want to rely on expensive cloud APIs or worry about privacy. Instead, I integrated **local Ollama** directly into the app.

Now, whenever I’m looking at a long-form piece of research or a complex news story, I can:
1.  **Generate Instant Summaries**: A 3-bullet breakdown of the core facts.
2.  **Vibe Check**: The app uses AI to mark headlines with sentiment dots (🟢 for positive, 🔴 for negative), helping me navigate the news cycle with less stress.
3.  **Chat with the Topic**: This is the real game-changer. I can literally "chat" with the article I’m reading. If a news story mentions a complex concept, I just ask the AI right there in the side panel. It has transformed my reading from passive consumption to an active dialogue.

## The Reality of Vibe Coding
As someone who doesn't come from a technical background, this journey was mind-blowing. I didn't spend months learning Python or React. Instead, I focused on the *vibe*—the user experience, the color schemes (from Cyberpunk neon to Sepia ebook tones), and the flow of information. 

By partnering with AI tools like Claude and Antigravity, I was able to explain what I wanted, review the plan, and watch the software come to life. 

## Conclusion
RSS Deck is my most complete version of software yet. It’s personalized, privacy-focused, and incredibly powerful. If you’ve ever felt like you had a great idea but "weren't a coder," I’m here to tell you that the era of the "vibe coder" is here—and it's a hell of a lot of fun.
